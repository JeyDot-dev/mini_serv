This is my first try at mini-serv.
It's not made to be the shortest, at first i wanted to use signals and stuff to make sure the program would be closed without any file and allocation leaks, but it is forbidden so..
To make it cleaner I'd definitely reduce the number of global variables but it would make functions that either require structures or multiple parameters, I'd like to keep it simple for the exam :)
